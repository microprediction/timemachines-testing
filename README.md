# timemachines-testing ([YOU ARE BEING REDIRECTED](https://github.com/microprediction/timeseries-elo-ratings)

### Deprecated

The [timeseries-elo-ratings](https://github.com/microprediction/timeseries-elo-ratings) package contains nicer [Elo rating tables](https://microprediction.github.io/timeseries-elo-ratings/html_leaderboards/univariate-k_003.html) than here. I suggest you check it out. 

### 

This repo may continue to be used for other styles of testing of the [timemachines](https://github.com/microprediction/timemachines) package. 


### Optimizer Elo ratings and leaderboards

If you are looking for optimizer leaderboards, I moved those to [HumpDay](https://github.com/microprediction/humpday). The precise methodology is revealed in [comparison/eloratings.py](https://github.com/microprediction/humpday/blob/main/humpday/comparison/eloratings.py) and explained in the article [HumpDay: A Package to Help You Choose a Python Global Optimizer](http://www.microprediction.com/blog/humpday).
