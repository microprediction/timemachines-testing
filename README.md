Standalone time intensive testing of the timemachines package that generates Elo ratings as a byproduct. 

### Optimizer Elo ratings and leaderboards

See [optimizer_elo_ratings/leaderboards](https://github.com/microprediction/timemachines-testing/tree/main/optimizer_elo_ratings/leaderboards/overall) for current rankings and Elo ratings. 


### Model Elo ratings and leaderboards

Arranged by how many steps ahead we predict. See [skater_elo_ratings/leaderboards](https://github.com/microprediction/timemachines-testing/tree/main/skater_elo_ratings/leaderboards) sub-directories. For example some good ways to predict univariate time series 8 steps in advance might be suggested by the rankings at [/leaderboards/univariate_008](https://github.com/microprediction/timemachines-testing/tree/main/skater_elo_ratings/leaderboards/univariate_008) but of course their are caveats.
